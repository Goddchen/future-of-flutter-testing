## Notes

* checks package
* Why testing? Regression bugs, mathematical proof of benefits?
* Migration, how?
* Examples
* What do you gain from testing at all and migrating?
* Audience: no testing at all, non developers, testing with matcher
* what is > what could be > actions > benefits

What to gain:
* type safetly
* statically typed at compile time
* State of the art
* Official
* Customizable
* Better IDE integration (autocomplete)

What is:
* package test
* matcher transitive dependency of test
* dynamic types
* async expectations await not enforced

What could be:
* checks package
* See "What to gain"

Actions:
* https://github.com/dart-lang/test/blob/master/pkgs/checks/doc/migrating_from_matcher.md#improvements-you-can-expect
* Partial migration
* Full migration
* 

Benefits:
* See "What to gain"

Appendix:
* spec package
